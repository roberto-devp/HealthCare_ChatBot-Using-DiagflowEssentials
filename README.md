# Intents in the HealthCare ChatBot Project:
In the HealthCare ChatBot project, intents play a pivotal role in understanding and categorizing the end-user's intentions during a conversation turn. Intents are predefined categories that represent the purpose or goal of a user's input. Here's an overview of the intents defined in this project:

1.Aadhar card:

This intent is designed to capture and handle user inquiries or information related to Aadhar card details. It ensures secure and accurate processing of Aadhar-related queries.

2.Age:

The age intent is responsible for extracting and managing user-provided age information. It plays a crucial role in tailoring the vaccination appointment process based on the user's age group.

3.Approval:

The approval intent deals with user responses indicating consent or approval. It facilitates the confirmation of appointment bookings and ensures a smooth interaction flow.

4.Default fallback intent:

When the ChatBot encounters user input that doesn't match any specific intent, the default fallback intent comes into play. It gracefully handles unexpected queries, guiding users back to the intended conversation flow.

5.Default welcome intent:

The default welcome intent provides a friendly greeting and initiates the conversation with users. It sets the tone for a positive and user-friendly interaction.

6.Denial:

The denial intent captures user responses indicating rejection or disapproval. It is crucial for managing user preferences and decisions during the appointment booking process.

6.Female:

This intent focuses on extracting and managing user-provided gender information when the user identifies as female.

7.Male:

Similar to the female intent, the male intent manages user-provided gender information but specifically for users identifying as male.

8.Names:

The names intent is responsible for recognizing and extracting user-provided names. It ensures accurate personalization during the appointment booking process.

9.Times:

The times intent handles user queries related to appointment scheduling times. It interprets and processes the time preferences specified by the user.

10.Transgender:

This intent is designed to recognize and manage user-provided gender information when the user identifies as transgender. It contributes to the inclusivity of the HealthCare ChatBot.

# How Intents Work:

When a user interacts with the HealthCare ChatBot, the system uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) to match the user's input (end-user expression) to the most relevant intent. This process, known as intent classification, ensures that the ChatBot understands the user's intention and responds appropriately.
